// @ts-nocheck TODO(typecheck): many inferred-shape errors from untyped option objects, not bugs; annotate with JSDoc when tightening
// The gate. Composes the two layers, and owns the one thing v1 and v2 only
// ever expressed in comments: THEY FAIL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, ON PURPOSE.
//
//   capability  needs no state  ->  FAIL CLOSED
//   economics   needs state     ->  FAIL OPEN
//
// Both halves of that are load-bearing. Failing closed on spend would mean a
// governor that blocks real work over a missing file of its own, which has
// failed at something more important than enforcing. Failing open on
// capability made `rm ~/.enforcer-governor/state.json` a way to switch off
// every rule — and, worse, it was the state the tool sat in by default: on the
// machine this was found on, the v1 hook ran before all 19 tool calls of a
// session and enforced nothing, because the daemon it asked was not running.
// Every call returned "allow (not checked)" and nobody noticed.
//
// Everything the gate needs is injected. That is not ceremony: it means the
// whole decision path is testable without a lock, a disk, or a clock, and it
// is the seam where the cost source is swapped for the harness's own figure
// without any of the logic below knowing.

 * The asymmetry is the design, so it is spelled out as a table rather than
 * left to be inferred from branches:
 *
 *                 local deny   local ask       local rewrite
 *   tenant deny   deny         deny            deny
 *   tenant ask    deny         ask (tenant's)  ask (tenant's)
 *   tenant allow  deny         no objection    rewrite
 *   silent        deny         ask             rewrite
 *   unreachable   deny         ask             rewrite
 *
 * A tenant can make anything stricter and can waive a confirmation. It cannot
 * lift a local hard deny, and it cannot skip a rewrite, which already runs
 * what was asked in a safer form. Losing the tenant's answer changes nothing.
