name: graph
description: Work a plan held in enforcer-graph — claim the next runnable node yourself, do it, keep the lease alive, report it against its acceptance criteria with captured command output as evidence. Use when a project has .claude/graph.json, when asked to "work the plan", "take the next node", "claim from the frontier", when a coordinator hands you a graph node to work as a subagent, when fanning a plan out to subagents, or when the enforcer-graph MCP tools (graph_next_work, graph_report, graph_heartbeat, graph_plan_status, graph_remember) are available.

# Working a graph

enforcer-graph holds a plan as a DAG. Nodes are tasks; each carries
`data.acceptance`, the list of lines your report will be judged against. You
never decide what to do next: the graph does, from the edges.

## The worker rule: whoever does the work claims and reports it

The plugin's hooks capture evidence **per agent**. A subagent's commands go
into that subagent's capture, and are attached only to a run **that same
agent** claimed with `graph_next_work`. A run claimed by anyone else gets none
of them. Measured: a coordinator claimed and reported 18 nodes on behalf of its
subagents, relaying their summaries as evidence, and all 18 were judged
`rejected / unsupported_by_evidence`.

- **Claim your own node with `graph_next_work`**, from the agent that will run
  the commands. If you were told to work a particular node, treat that as a
  hint: when the card hands you a different node, a sibling already took yours.
  Work the node you hold and say which one it is. On MCP 0.9.5 or newer, a
  coordinator can pin the claim: `graph_next_work` with `node` (key or id)
  claims exactly that node when it is runnable, and answers `not_runnable` with
  the reason when it is not. That is still `graph_next_work`, so the hooks
  follow it.
- **Never claim by id.** Do not claim through `enforcer_api_write` or
  `take_task`. The hooks only follow `graph_next_work`, so a run claimed any
  other way gets no heartbeat and no captured evidence.
- **No `graph_next_work` in your tools?** Your token lacks the graph write
  scopes (or the server predates enforcer-v3-mcp 0.9.4, which stopped hiding the
  worker tools from fine-scoped tokens). Stop and say so; do not fall back to
  `enforcer_api_write`. `/enforcer:login` with the graph scopes fixes it.
- **Report before you return.** The Stop guard does not run for subagents, so
  nothing reminds you. A run left open when you hand back is a lease that
  lapses with nothing to show for it.
- **Never report a node you did not claim.** Never re-report or re-judge one.

## The loop

1. **`graph_next_work`** (`graph`, optional `for`, `runner`, `node`, `upstream_depth`) — claims one runnable node under a row lock and returns
   one card: the node, its `criteria` (its own acceptance lines, the graph and
   tenant mandates marked `[mandate: …]`, and `[check]` rows the server
   evaluates in code), its `inputs` (values upstream nodes produced), attached
   `skills` (read them before starting), recent `observations` (facts earlier
   runs left), and the `run` you now hold (`run_id`, `lease_expires_at`). Two
   sessions can never receive the same node.
   - **`upstream`** (MCP 0.9.5+): for each prerequisite, nearest first, the
     run's report, observations, links and file ids, one `line` each to read
     first. Read it before you start; do not re-derive what it already says.
   - **`route`** (graph with routing on): the agent profile the router
     recommends for this node, and why. Advisory. `route: null` means routing is
     on and nothing is recommended. See "Following the route" below.
   - `state: wait` — nothing runnable, but something is running, verifying, or
     time-gated. When the card has `wait_until`, nothing can start before that
     instant: say so and stop. Do not poll in a tight loop.
   - `state: complete` — nothing runnable, running, verifying or time-gated. The
     plan is done, or failed nodes block the rest; the card says which. An
     **open** graph never completes: it answers `idle` instead, which means
     "nothing to do right now", not "finished".
   - **Assignment:** when the project config sets `graph.assignment` (`me` or
     `mine`), pass it as `for`. `assigned_elsewhere` means only other people's
     nodes are runnable; assignment is advisory, so take one only if a human
     says to.
2. **Work the node** in its own worktree or branch named after `node.key`.
3. **`graph_heartbeat`** (`graph`, `node_id`, `run_id`) — you hold a lease, not the node. The plugin's hook
   heartbeats every ten tool calls for you. Call it yourself before any long
   silent step, such as a build, a long test run or a wait on CI. The response `state` is an instruction:
   - `ok` — keep working.
   - `cancel_requested` — stop, `graph_remember` what is worth keeping, then
     `graph_report` with `status: cancelled`.
   - `reclaimed` — your lease lapsed and another harness owns the node. STOP.
     A report from this run will be refused. `graph_remember` any progress worth
     keeping, then `graph_next_work`.
   - `finished` — the run already ended. Nothing to report; `graph_next_work`.
     A graph **reset** also ends every open run this way: stop, re-read the
     plan (`graph_plan_status`), and never report the old run.
4. **`graph_report`** (`graph`, `node_id`, `run_id`, `status`, `report`, optional `pr`, `error`, `outputs`) — `status` is `succeeded`, `failed` or `cancelled`.
   The response carries `verification` (when judgment is enabled on the tenant),
   an `outputs` block when the node declares outputs, a `checks` block when its
   criteria hold `[check]` rows, and `frontier_after`, the nodes runnable after
   your outcome. They are not claimed; `graph_next_work` claims one.
   - `node_status: verifying` — the run succeeded under a gate policy and its
     verdict is pending (a re-judge, or a person's approval). Its dependents
     are held until the verdict. It is not yours to poll and not yours to
     retry: move on with `graph_next_work`.
5. **`graph_remember`** (`graph`, `node_id`, `body`, optional `source`) — write a fact about a node at any time: a decision, a
   measurement, something the next run must know. The server dedupes and can
   flag a contradiction with an earlier observation; read `judgment` in the
   response.

`graph_plan_status` is the whole plan on one card: counts, frontier, running,
verifying, waiting (with `not_before`), failed, unverified runs. Call it when asked how the plan stands, not every turn.

## Following the route

When the card's `route` names a profile with a `local_type`, that is the
subagent type the router picked for this node. Start a subagent of that type
(the Agent tool's `subagent_type`) and hand it the card's `upstream` bundle
(the lines to read first), the node's acceptance and the graph and node ids.
Because the worker rule holds, the node is claimed by whoever does the work:
if you are the worker, you are that subagent's type already, or you run it in
your own session; a coordinator never claims on the subagent's behalf. A route
without a `local_type` (an `agent` or `a2a` profile) is not something to start
locally: work the node yourself and say so.

The route is advice, not an order. If you depart from it (a different subagent
type, no subagent, or a different approach than the profile implies), write the
**override reason** into the report: one line naming the route, what you did
instead, and why. Departing silently is the failure; departing with a reason is
fine, and the reason is what lets the router learn.

## Evidence: the verdict is what the evidence shows

The judge never sees the repository. It asks whether the **evidence** shows
each criterion met. Your report is the claim, and a claim is not evidence: a
well-written report with nothing behind it scores like no report at all.

- **Evidence is captured, not written.** The plugin records every `Bash`
  command you run, with its exit code and output, and every `Edit`/`Write`,
  with its path. It attaches the record to `graph_report` for you and replaces
  anything you put in `evidence`. Reads, greps and globs are not captured. Do
  not hand-write `evidence`, and do not paste output into the report as proof.
- **Prove each line with a command that runs in your own session.** If you
  claim a test passes, run it. If you claim a file changed, show
  `git diff --stat`. If you claim a PR is merged, run
  `gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt`. The exit code is part of the record.
  A failing command is evidence too, and is kept first.
- **Long output goes to enforcer-files, whole.** Each output is clipped to
  4000 characters, keeping both ends. If `files_base_url` is set in
  `.claude/graph.json`, the attach hook uploads any longer output to the user's
  enforcer-files and the evidence item carries its `file` id; you do nothing.
  Without that setting, upload the log yourself through Bash, so that the
  upload is captured too (this is the `enforcer-files:upload` skill run as a
  command):
  `node "$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/enforcer-files/*/bin/files.mjs | tail -1)" upload <log> --dir graph-evidence`.
  Then cite the file id it prints in the report line the log supports.
- **Prose only supports.** The report says which evidence answers which
  criterion; it cannot stand in for the evidence. At most 20 items are
  attached: failures first, then the most recent. Run the decisive checks last.
- **Cost is stamped for you.** The same hook writes `data.usage` on the run —
  model, tokens and tool calls since your claim, from your own transcript — so
  a plan can be costed with `graph_query`. Do not pass it yourself. Output
  tokens there are an estimate; input and cache counts are exact.
- **Keep tool output small; it is re-read every turn.** Each result stays in
  your context for the rest of the run, so a 7k-token log at turn 10 of 60 is
  paid for 50 times. Measured: workers spent 96–98% of their input re-reading
  old tool output. Send long commands to a file and read the end and the
  failures: `bash scripts/verify.sh > /tmp/v.log 2>&1; echo EXIT=$?; tail -40
  /tmp/v.log`, `go test ./... 2>&1 | grep -E '^(FAIL|ok|panic)|--- FAIL' | head
  -50`. Read a file's range (`sed -n`, `grep -n`, or Read with offset), never
  `cat` a whole file. Batch independent commands in one call. Do not re-run a
  gate on a tree nothing changed.

Write the report as a numbered list in the card's `criteria` order. Mark each
line **MET** or **NOT MET** and name the command or file id that shows it.
Report `succeeded` only when every line is met. Otherwise report `failed`, with
`error` saying what the next attempt needs. "Not met, because X" scores
honestly.

### Worked example

```
# graph_next_work -> node fix-lease-race, run r-81
#   criteria: 1. lease race test passes under -race   2. PR merged to main
$ go test -race -count=20 ./internal/runs/        # captured: exit 0, output
$ gh pr create --fill                             # captured: the PR URL
$ gh pr checks 212 --watch && gh pr merge 212 --squash
$ gh pr view 212 --json state,mergedAt            # captured: MERGED
graph_report status=succeeded pr=https://github.com/o/r/pull/212 report=
  1. Race test — MET. `go test -race -count=20 ./internal/runs/` exit 0,
     "ok enforcer-graph/internal/runs".
  2. PR merged — MET. `gh pr view 212`: state MERGED, mergedAt 2026-09-30T02:11Z.
```

Compare a coordinator writing "The subagent reports the race is fixed and the
tests pass." That is prose, and it is judged `unsupported_by_evidence` however
true it is.

## When the work departs from the plan

Acceptance lines go stale: a file moves, an approach fails, an upstream
decision changes. Never do something else quietly and report it as met.

1. `graph_remember` on the node: what the line says, what you did instead,
   and why.
2. In the report, mark that line **NOT MET — STALE: <why>**. Report `failed`
   unless every line that still applies is met and a person has said the stale
   one may go. Do not edit the node's acceptance to fit your work; that is the
   plan author's call.

## Done means merged

When the plan has merge nodes (nodes whose acceptance says a PR is merged), an
open PR is not done. On a merge node, `succeeded` needs `gh pr view` showing
`state` MERGED in your evidence. A PR that is open, failing CI or waiting for
review is NOT MET: report `failed` with the PR URL in `pr`. On the node before
a merge node, open the PR, pass `pr` and report. Do not merge it unless your
own node says to.

To merge, run the plugin's lander, which needs no model in the loop:
`"$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/enforcer-graph/*/bin/land-pr.sh | tail -1)" <n>`.
It queues `gh pr merge <n> --squash --auto`, keeps the branch current, and exits
0 merged (printing the evidence below), 2 CI failed, 3 conflicts, 4 timed out. When the base branch
requires branches to be up to date, GitHub merges only once the PR is current
and green; if it falls behind, `gh pr update-branch <n>` (or rebase, re-verify,
push) and it stays queued. Do not poll `gh pr view` in a loop or re-run the full
verify on a branch nothing changed. The merge evidence is the end state, not
the steps: `gh pr view <n> --json state,mergeCommit` showing MERGED, and
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <mergeCommit> origin/<base>` exiting 0.

## Coordinating subagents

If you fan the plan out, you coordinate and the workers claim. Fan-out is your
whole job.

1. Read the frontier with `graph_plan_status`. Spawn at most one worker per
   frontier node, each in its own worktree. Do not claim anything yourself.
2. Give each worker the graph id, the node key and id you expect it to get, its
   acceptance lines, and this instruction: *"Load the `enforcer-graph:graph`
   skill. Claim with `graph_next_work` passing `node: <key>`, work the node you
   are handed, heartbeat through long steps, and `graph_report` it yourself
   before you return. Tell me the node key, run id, status and verdict."*
   **Hand a worker a specific node with `graph_next_work`'s `node` parameter
   (MCP 0.9.5 or newer), not by claiming by id.** Parallel workers each asking
   for "the top of the frontier" race and may swap nodes; `node` removes the
   race and keeps the claim a `graph_next_work` claim the hooks follow. On an
   older server `node` is unknown: fall back to the guidance above (a plain
   `graph_next_work`; if it hands back a different node, work that one and say
   so). Never claim by id through `enforcer_api_write` as a workaround. Also
   give the worker the card's `route` and `upstream` if you have them; the
   worker's own claim returns them anyway.
3. When workers return, read `graph_plan_status` again and fan out the new
   frontier. Never call `graph_report` for a worker, never re-report or re-judge
   its node, and never heartbeat its run. If a worker's verdict is rejected, a
   new attempt by a worker fixes it. A better summary from you does not.
4. **Contested resources are not parallel work.** Two frontier nodes with no
   edge between them can still collide on one shared thing: a migration number,
   a reservation file, a lockfile, one generated file. The graph only serializes
   what an edge says. Before fanning out, assign each worker its value (claim
   the migration number in the repo's reservation file yourself, in its own PR,
   and put it in the worker's prompt), or add a `requires` edge so the second
   waits for the first. Never let two workers each discover "the next free one".
5. **Merge nodes are mechanical; batch them.** Fan out the build work in
   parallel; land the merges through one worker per repo, in order, each queued
   with `--auto`. N parallel merge workers on one repo each rebase onto a base
   the others keep moving, and every move is a full verify for nothing.
6. **Launch each worker at its node's tier.** The card's `model` (when the
   server sends one) and the node's `data.tier` say how much model it needs;
   launch the worker at that model (the Agent tool's `model`). The tier maps: `mechanical` → a script (`land-pr.sh`, the release
   make targets) or Haiku; `standard` → Sonnet; `deep` → Opus. `tier_source`
   says who decided — `user` beats `planner` beats `rule` beats `jev`, so a
   tier the user set through MCP is never second-guessed by you. A node with no
   tier is `standard`, except merge/release/chore (`mechanical`) and a gate or
   anything touching authz, tokens or a hot-table migration (`deep`). A node on
   its second attempt goes up one tier. A node marked `detail: thin` has only a
   pointer for a description: its tier is a rule's guess, so give its worker
   the design section to read and say the tier is provisional.

## Inputs and outputs

- **Read inputs from the card; never re-derive them.** `inputs` says where each
  value came from (`image (docker_image) = ghcr.io/… — from ship-fix attempt 1,
  extracted 0.97`); `input_values` holds it exactly. Do not re-run `git
  rev-parse`, re-read a log or re-compute a number to get a value the card
  already handed you: the point is that the value is the one the upstream run
  was judged on. An input marked `ABSENT` is not an error — proceed without it,
  or report why you cannot. **Inputs never cross epochs:** after a reset they
  resolve from the current epoch's runs only, unless the plan writes the input
  as `<key>.<output>@previous`. Don't go looking for an earlier epoch's value.
- **Declare `outputs` only for computed values.** Anything verbatim in your
  evidence — a PR URL, a commit sha, a pushed image — is extracted from the
  evidence without you. Pass `outputs: {name: value}` on `graph_report` only
  for what you computed or chose (a count, a variance, an id you picked). Each
  declared value is judged against the evidence and dropped when the evidence
  does not show it, so the command that produced it must have run.
- **A verifying node is not yours to poll.** Its verdict arrives on the run
  (a worker re-judge, or a person approving it in `graph_review`). Do not
  heartbeat it, re-report it or call `graph_plan_status` in a loop waiting for
  it; take other work, or stop.
- **A reset is a human's call.** `graph_reset` starts a new epoch and can
  cancel running work. Never reset a graph to get unstuck, to retry, or because
  a loop looks due (the server's loop worker does that). Only reset when a
  person asks, through the tool's own confirmation.

## Two conventions that silently invert the plan if reversed

- **A dependency edge points FROM the dependent TO its prerequisite.**
  `build --requires--> setup` means "build requires setup". The frontier is the
  set of unfinished nodes whose every outgoing `requires` edge points at a done
  node. Reverse an edge and the plan runs backwards without an error.
- **A repeated step is a node with several runs, never a loop edge.** A retry is
  attempt N+1 on the same node. On a dag-mode graph an edge that would close a
  cycle is refused with `409 edge_would_create_cycle`.

## Before stopping

Report the run, or say explicitly that you are leaving it open. In a top-level
session the plugin's Stop hook sends you back once if a run is open and
unreported. A subagent gets no such reminder.
